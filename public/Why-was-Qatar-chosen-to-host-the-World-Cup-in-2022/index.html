      Why was Qatar chosen to host the World Cup in 2022

        <h1 id="Why-was-Qatar-chosen-to-host-the-World-Cup-in-2022"><a href="#Why-was-Qatar-chosen-to-host-the-World-Cup-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Why was Qatar chosen to host the World Cup in 2022?"></a>Why was Qatar chosen to host the World Cup in 2022?</h1><p>The short answer is that Qatar was the only bidder left. The longer answer is a little more complicated.</p>
<p>Qatar won the right to host the World Cup in 2022 in a vote by FIFA’s board of directors on December 2, 2010. The other bidding countries were the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Australia.</p>
<p>FIFA’s initial selection process was to include Egypt and Morocco, but they were later disqualified for not meeting eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>Qatar was chosen over the United States even though the U.S. bid offered more stadiums and more development programs for FIFA $221 million vs. Qatar’s $150 million. It has been speculated that FIFA’s votes may have been influenced by bribes from Qatari officials.</p>
<p>Qatar has faced intense scrutiny and criticism since winning the bid. Allegations of bribery, corruption, and human rights abuses have plagued Qatar ever since. In addition, concerns have been raised about the extreme heat during the summer months when the World Cup is scheduled to take place.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-stadiums-are-currently-planned-or-being-built-for-the-World-Cup"><a href="#How-many-stadiums-are-currently-planned-or-being-built-for-the-World-Cup" class="headerlink" title="How many stadiums are currently planned or being built for the World Cup?"></a>How many stadiums are currently planned or being built for the World Cup?</h1><p>As of November 2017, there are twelve stadiums either planned or under construction for the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. </p>
<p>Nine stadiums were initially planned for the event, but two additional venues were announced in October 2017. Khalifa International Stadium will now host the opening and final matches, while Al Bayt Stadium will become the first World Cup stadium to be completed in Qatar.</p>
<p>The stadiums that have either been completed or are currently under construction are as follows: </p>
<p>Al Bayt Stadium (Al Khor)<br>Qatar Sports Club Stadium (Doha)<br>Lusail Iconic Stadium (Lusail)<br>Ras Abu Aboud Stadium (Doha)<br>Al Wakrah Stadium (Al Wakrah)<br>Education City Arena (Doha)<br>Fahd bin Khalifa Stadium (Al Rayyan)<br> al-Thumama Stadium (al-Thumama)</p>
<h1 id="How-have-Qatar’s-preparations-for-the-World-Cup-been-going"><a href="#How-have-Qatar’s-preparations-for-the-World-Cup-been-going" class="headerlink" title="How have Qatar’s preparations for the World Cup been going?"></a>How have Qatar’s preparations for the World Cup been going?</h1><p>The 2022 World Cup is just three years away, but there are still many questions surrounding Qatar’s preparations for the event. The country has been criticized for its treatment of migrant workers, and there are concerns about the heat and humidity during the summer months.</p>
<p>Qatar has responded to the criticism by making some changes to its labor laws, but much more needs to be done. The government has also promised to air-condition all of the stadiums and create dedicated fan zones, but it remains to be seen if these measures will be enough to make the tournament a success.</p>
<p>There have been some positive signs in recent months, with Qatar winning the bid to host the 2019 World Athletics Championships and announcing expansion plans for Doha Airport. The country is also investing billions of dollars in new infrastructure projects, including a metro system and a new port.</p>
<p>Qatar is clearly determined to make a success of the World Cup, but there are still some significant challenges ahead. If all goes well, though, it could be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for fans from around the world.</p>
<h1 id="What-has-been-the-cost-of-preparing-Qatar-to-host-the-World-Cup"><a href="#What-has-been-the-cost-of-preparing-Qatar-to-host-the-World-Cup" class="headerlink" title="What has been the cost of preparing Qatar to host the World Cup?"></a>What has been the cost of preparing Qatar to host the World Cup?</h1><p>Qatar has been preparing to host the FIFA World Cup for over a decade and the cost of this preparation has been high. Qatar has made significant investments in transport, accommodation, and stadiums in order to host the event.</p>
<p>The cost of preparing Qatar for the World Cup is estimated to be around $200 billion. This cost includes new infrastructure projects such as airports, highways, and stadiums, as well as the renovation of existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>Qatar has faced criticism for spending so much money on preparing for the World Cup, when there are many other needs in the country. However, Qatar says that hosting the World Cup will bring many benefits to the country, including increased tourism and investment.</p>
<p>The first stadium in Qatar to be completed was Al Bayt Stadium in May 2014. The stadium was built at a cost of $545 million and can accommodate up to 60,000 spectators. The Lusail Stadium, which will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the World Cup, is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in 2020. The stadium will have a capacity of 86,000 spectators.</p>
<p>Other stadiums that have been or are being built include:<br>-Al Wakrah Stadium: capacity 40,000; cost $745 million<br>-Al Rayyan Stadium: capacity 44,740; cost $1.2 billion<br>-Khalifa International Stadium: capacity 68,030; cost $90 million</p>
<p>Qatar has also made significant investments in transport infrastructure in order to accommodate the influx of tourists for the World Cup. New airports have been built or are being built in Doha, Al Wakrah, and Hamad International Airport. The new airports will have a combined total capacity of 110 million passengers annually.</p>
<p>Highways and railway lines have also been upgraded or constructed in order to support increased traffic during the World Cup. The new Hamad Port has also been completed in order to handle increased shipping traffic during the event.</p>
<h1 id="Will-the-World-Cup-be-moved-to-a-different-country-due-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic"><a href="#Will-the-World-Cup-be-moved-to-a-different-country-due-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic" class="headerlink" title="Will the World Cup be moved to a different country due to the coronavirus pandemic?"></a>Will the World Cup be moved to a different country due to the coronavirus pandemic?</h1><p>There is a lot of speculation at the moment about whether or not the World Cup will be moved from its planned location in Qatar to a different country. This is in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused a lot of governments to shut down their borders in an attempt to contain the virus.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a major sporting event has been moved because of a health crisis. The Olympic Games were moved from Tokyo to Sapporo in 1940 due to World War II, and the Seoul Summer Olympics were moved to Incheon in 1988 due to the outbreak of ebola.</p>
<p>So far, FIFA has not released any official statement about moving the World Cup. However, there have been some reports that Qatar is considering postponing the event until late 2020 or even 2021. There have also been rumours that Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are considering hosting the event instead.</p>
<p>It is still too early to say what will happen with the World Cup, but it is clear that this pandemic is causing a lot of disruption around the world. We will just have to wait and see what happens in the coming weeks and months</p>
