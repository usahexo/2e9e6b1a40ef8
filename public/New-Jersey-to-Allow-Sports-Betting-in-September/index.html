        <h1 id="New-Jersey-to-Allow-Sports-Betting-in-September"><a href="#New-Jersey-to-Allow-Sports-Betting-in-September" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey to Allow Sports Betting in September"></a>New Jersey to Allow Sports Betting in September</h1><p>In a landmark ruling on Monday, the Supreme Court struck down a law that barred most states from legalizing sports betting. This ruling paves the way for New Jersey to allow sports betting at its casinos and racetracks starting in September.</p>
<p>New Jersey has been trying to legalize sports betting for years, but the previous law prohibited it. The state argued that the law violated the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, which reserves power to the states.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court agreed with New Jersey, ruling that the law was unconstitutional. Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion that “the Constitution leaves it to Congress to decide whether gambling on sporting events is evil or good.”</p>
<p>This ruling opens up the possibility for other states to legalize sports betting as well. Delaware, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have already passed laws legalizing sports betting in anticipation of Monday’s ruling.</p>
<p>Casinos and racetracks in New Jersey are celebrating this news, as they expect it to bring in millions of dollars in revenue. The Monmouth Park racetrack has said it will start taking bets within two weeks of September, and several casinos are promising quick expansions of their sports books.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Approves-SportsBetting-Operators-Ramp-Up-Efforts"><a href="#New-Jersey-Approves-SportsBetting-Operators-Ramp-Up-Efforts" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Approves SportsBetting, Operators Ramp Up Efforts"></a>New Jersey Approves SportsBetting, Operators Ramp Up Efforts</h1><p>On June 11, 2018, the New Jersey state Assembly approved a sports betting bill that would allow casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting. The move comes after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law in May that banned gambling on individual sporting events in most states.</p>
<p>Since the Supreme Court’s decision, a number of states have been moving to approve legislation that would allow sports betting within their borders. In anticipation of the New Jersey vote, several operators, including DraftKings, FanDuel, and MGM Resorts, have announced plans to offer sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>The New Jersey bill still needs to be approved by the state Senate and signed into law by Governor Phil Murphy, but both of those steps are considered to be mere formalities. Once the bill is signed into law, operators will have to apply for licenses from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement in order to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>Nevada was the first state to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court’s ruling. Since then, Delaware, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Rhode Island have also moved to legalize sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="State-Assembly-Passes-Bill-Allowing-Sports-Betting"><a href="#State-Assembly-Passes-Bill-Allowing-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="State Assembly Passes Bill Allowing Sports Betting"></a>State Assembly Passes Bill Allowing Sports Betting</h1><p>On Monday, the state assembly in New York passed a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The bill, which has been pushed by Governor Andrew Cuomo, would allow casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>The move comes as several other states have also moved to legalize sports betting in the wake of a Supreme Court decision last year that struck down a federal ban on the practice.</p>
<p>Cuomo hailed the passage of the bill, saying it would help “generate hundreds of millions of dollars for our schools and for upgrades to our aging transportation infrastructure.”</p>
<p>However, the bill still needs to be approved by the state Senate before it can become law. That is not seen as being a major obstacle, however, as the Senate is also controlled by Democrats.</p>
<p>Supporters say that legalizing sports betting will help bring more revenue to the state government, while opponents argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction problems.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Poised-to-Become-First-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Gambling-in-Aftermath-of-SCOTUS-Ruling"><a href="#NJ-Poised-to-Become-First-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Gambling-in-Aftermath-of-SCOTUS-Ruling" class="headerlink" title="NJ Poised to Become First State to Legalize Sports Gambling in Aftermath of SCOTUS Ruling"></a>NJ Poised to Become First State to Legalize Sports Gambling in Aftermath of SCOTUS Ruling</h1><p>On May 14, 2018, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of New jersey in a 6-3 decision, effectively striking down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992. The Christie administration had previously argued that the law – which forbids states from authorizing sports gambling – violated the 10th Amendment of the US Constitution by infringing on state rights.</p>
<p>The court’s ruling clears the way for NJ to become the first state to legalize sports gambling in the aftermath of the decision. Governor Phil Murphy has already pledged to sign legislation authorizing sports betting within two weeks of the ruling, and Monmouth Park Racetrack plans to offer betting on Memorial Day.</p>
<p>While other states are likely to follow suit, it is unclear how quickly they will be able to do so. The Delaware Lottery announced shortly after the ruling that it plans to offer betting on NFL games starting in September, but regulations still need to be drafted and approved. West Virginia also announced plans to legalize sports gambling “in a matter of days”, while Pennsylvania and New York are both considering bills that would allow wagers within their borders.</p>
<p>At present, Nevada is the only state where sports gambling is legal.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s ruling opens up a new revenue stream for both state governments and professional sports leagues. In its brief, NJ estimated that legalized sports gambling could generate up to $500 million in annual tax revenue. The American Gaming Association (AGA) estimates that overall gaming revenue from legal sports betting could top $7 billion annually.</p>
<p>Leagues like the NFL and MLB stand to gain as well; they have been seeking a cut of state-sanctioned gambling revenues for years in order to help protect their integrity. The NBA and NHL have also voiced support for legalized sports betting, with commissioner Adam Silver arguing that it would be “a mistake not to capitalize on this opportunity”.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports gambling contend that it will lead to increased levels of corruption in sport. However, there is no evidence that this is currently the case in Nevada or any other jurisdiction where such betting is legal.</p>
<p>In light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, it is likely that other states will follow suit and begin legalizing sports gambling. This could provide a major financial windfall for cash-strapped state governments while also generating new revenue for professional sports leagues.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Mulls-Offering-Sports-Betting-In-light-of-Federal-Ruling"><a href="#New-Jersey-Mulls-Offering-Sports-Betting-In-light-of-Federal-Ruling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Mulls Offering Sports Betting In light of Federal Ruling"></a>New Jersey Mulls Offering Sports Betting In light of Federal Ruling</h1><p>After the Supreme Court struck down a law prohibiting states from legalizing sports betting, New Jersey is now considering whether to offer it.</p>
<p>Republican State Senator Ray Lesniak said he will soon introduce a bill to allow sports betting in New Jersey racetracks and casinos.</p>
<p>“It’s not a question of if we’re going to have sports betting in New Jersey, it’s when,” Lesniak said Monday. “The sooner we get this done, the sooner we can start collecting the tax revenue and create jobs.”</p>
<p>State Assemblyman Ralph Caputo, a Democrat, says he also plans to introduce a bill.</p>
<p>New Jersey has been pushing to legalize sports betting since 2012, when the state lost its case before the Supreme Court. In that case, the court ruled that Congress could prohibit states from authorizing sports gambling. But in Monday’s ruling, the court said individual states could legalize it if they choose.</p>
<p>Supporters say legalizing sports betting would bring much-needed revenue to New Jersey’s struggling casinos and racetracks. An estimate by Econsult Solutions Inc. found that legalized sports betting in New Jersey could bring in more than $13 million in annual tax revenue.</p>
<p>Opponents argue that legalizing sports betting would lead to more gambling addiction and crime. They also say it would harm the integrity of sporting events.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy has not yet taken a position on whether to legalize sports betting in New Jersey.</p>
