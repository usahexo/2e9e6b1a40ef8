#  How to play poker for beginners Australia?

The very first thing that you will need to do in order to play poker is to find a reputable poker room. The best way to do this is by doing some online research or by reading online reviews. Once you have found a room that you are comfortable with, you will then need to create an account and make a deposit.

Now that you have an account set-up and some funds in your account, it’s time to start learning the basics of the game. In poker, there are two main variants which are Texas Hold’em and Omaha. Most poker rooms will offer both variants, so it’s important that you choose the variant that you feel most comfortable with.

Texas Hold’em is the more popular of the two variants, so we will start with this one. The aim of the game is to create the best five-card hand possible using two downcards and five community cards. The first step is to Ante up which will create a pot for the hand. Each player is then dealt two cards face down which are known as their hole cards.

The next step is called the flop, which is where three community cards are placed face up in the middle of the table. At this point, each player can use either one or both of their hole cards in order to make the best five-card hand possible. The fourth community card is called the turn and this card is placed one at a time until all players have had a chance to act on it. The final community card is called the river and this card completes the board.

Now that all players have had their turn, it’s time for them to reveal their hands. The player with the best hand wins the pot, which contains all of the money that has been bet during the hand plus any side pots that may have been created. If there is a tie, then the pot is divided equally between all players who have tied for winning hands.

Now that we have covered Texas Hold’em, let’s move on to Omaha. Omaha is also a popular variant and can be quite complex for beginners. The aim of Omaha is similar to Texas Hold’em; however, each player must use two hole cards and three community cards in order to make their best five-card hand possible. Another difference between Omaha and Texas Hold’em is that in Omaha, players are not allowed to use both of their hole cards together in order to make a straight or flush like they can in Texas Hold’em; instead they must use one hole card and three community cards respectively.

Each player once again antes up at the start of a hand and then receives four hole cards instead of two like in Texas Hold’em. After looking at their four hole cards, players must discard two before receiving fifth street (the flop) – just like in Hold ‘Em but they now MUST play TWO from what remains (ie TWO open pairs). Sixth street (the turn) sees another card added making seven active – but only six remain as one has been put back into play by discarding on fourth street – likewise on seventh (river) where FIVE become four because one put back into play by discarding on sixth street). As always there MUST be exactly FIVE playing at showdown for either game variant if heads up OR for PLO eight handed/games with more than 2 players). So there are more opportunities for different types of hands being made BUT also chances for other player(s) holding better hands IF someone else discards what would have helped them!
