Bingo bango bongo Niger (or BBBN for short) is a popular drinking game that can be played by any number of people. The basic premise is simple – players take turns drawing cards, and if they match any of the numbers on their card, they must drink. The first player to fill up their card wins!

To get started, you’ll need a deck of cards and some drinks. (If you don’t have any drinks handy, check out our list of recipes for some delicious cocktails that will help get the party started!) Shuffle the deck and deal out all of the cards evenly among players.

The player who draws the highest card goes first. On their turn, they draw one card from the deck and place it face-up in front of them. If they match any of the numbers on their card with those on their drawn card, they must drink. If they do not match any numbers, they must place another card face-up in front of them and draw another card.

If at any time a player draws two cards that match (e.g. two 4s), they must drink twice. If they draw three cards that match (e.g. three 6s), they must drink three times, and so on.

The first player to fill up their card wins!
