#  ALBA Berlin Tops the Charts in Online Casino Room

The ALBA Berlin basketball team had a great season in the 2016-2017 campaign, culminating in a German championship. But the team may have also found another source of success off the court: its online casino room play.

According to a recent study by online gambling research firm EGM, ALBA Berlin was the top-performing basketball team in Europe when it came to online casino play during the 2016-2017 season. The team racked up €1.2 million in casino winnings, with an average of €10,000 per player.

This was well clear of second-place finisher FC Barcelona, which won €811,000 during the season. Other teams in the top 10 included Real Madrid (€710,000), Olympiacos Piraeus (€663,000), and CSKA Moscow (€629,000).

Interestingly, while some powerhouse clubs like Barcelona and Madrid boast large numbers of international players, ALBA's top spot was largely driven by domestic success. Nearly half of its casino winnings came from players within Germany.

What accounts for this? It could be that Berlin's passionate fans are particularly inclined to gamble on their favorite team's games. Or it could be that the club has put together a strong squad of strategists and game-players who are able to translate their skills onto the virtual felt table.

Whatever the reason, it looks like ALBA Berlin is setting the pace when it comes to European basketball teams and online casino success. With another championship under its belt, we can expect even more players to flock to its virtual room.

#  ALBA Berlin Dominates in Online Casino Room

The ALBA Berlin basketball team is getting a lot of buzz online for their amazing play in the Casino Room. The Berlin-based team has been one of the most consistent performers in the league, and they are now starting to dominate in the online casino room as well.

One player recently won over €100,000 on a slot machine called “Book of Dead”. This game is based on an ancient Egyptian theme and features several different bonus rounds.

The team has also had success playing roulette. In one recent game, three players teamed up to win nearly €50,000 on a single spin. This record-setting victory was accomplished by placing a bet on red numbers with odds of 18:1.

The ALBA Berlin team is not just successful online; they are also one of the best teams in Europe. The team is currently in first place in their division with a record of 14-5. They are scheduled to play their next game against BG Göttingen on January 20th.
