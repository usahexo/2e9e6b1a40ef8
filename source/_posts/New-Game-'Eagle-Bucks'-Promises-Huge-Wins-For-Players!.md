#  Taxman Looms Over Couples Who Win Big In Gambling Game!

In the state of Nevada, it is considered a felony for a person to knowingly and intentionally calculate and record the outcome of a gambling game. The result of this law being enforced is that couples who have won a large sum of money from gambling are now finding themselves in the crosshairs of the IRS.

The couple in question, who wish to remain anonymous, have stated that they have won over $1 million from playing blackjack in local casinos. To avoid any legal trouble, they have decided to split their winnings and keep only $600,000 each.

Even though the couple has technically done nothing wrong by splitting their winnings and keeping them within the confines of Nevada law, they are still subject to audit by the IRS. This is because, technically, their winnings are considered income, regardless of how it was obtained.

It will be interesting to see how this case plays out in court. If the couple is found guilty of deliberately recording the outcome of a gambling game, they could face up to 5 years in prison and a hefty fine.

#  Are You Avoiding Taxes On Your Gambling Winnings?

Many people enjoy gambling and the rush of winning money. What they may not know is that they could be skirting around taxes on their winnings. The good news is that there are ways to enjoy gambling and minimize your tax liability.

It’s important to understand the tax implications of gambling so you can make the most of your winnings. Different types of gambling have different tax implications, so it’s important to know what type of gambler you are.

The first thing to understand is that the IRS classifies gambling income as taxable income. This means that any money you win from gambling is subject to taxation. However, there are a few exceptions. Gambling losses can be used to offset gambling income, but only up to the amount of your gambling income. In other words, you can't use your losses to offset other types of income.

In general, the IRS taxes gambling income at a rate of 28%. However, this rate can vary depending on your income level and other factors. There are a few ways to reduce or avoid taxes on your gambling income altogether. Let’s take a look at some of them:

1) Claim your losses: As we mentioned earlier, you can use your losses to offset your taxable gambling income. This can help reduce your overall tax liability. Keep in mind though that you can only claim losses up to the amount of your taxable income from gambling. So if you only had $500 in taxable gambling income, you could only claim $500 in losses.

2) Charitable contributions: Another way to reduce your tax liability is by making charitable contributions. Many charitable organizations are considered “exempt organizations” by the IRS, which means that donations made to these organizations are tax deductible. Consult with your accountant or tax advisor to see if any of the organizations you donate to qualify as exempt organizations.

3) Tax treaties: If you reside in a country that has a tax treaty with the United States, you may be able to offset or exempt certain amounts of gambling income from taxation. Each treaty is different, so it’s important to consult with an attorney who specializes in international tax law if you think this may apply to you.

4) Home office deduction: If you gamble from home, you may be able to take a home office deduction for any related expenses. This includes things like rent or mortgage payments, utilities, insurance, and repairs/maintenance costs . . . just make sure that your home office meets all the requirements set forth by the IRS . Talk with an accountant or tax advisor about whether this option might work for you . 


As you can see, there are several ways to reduce or avoid taxes on your gambling income altogether. It’s important to consult with an accountant or tax advisor to find out which methods will work best for you based on your individual situation

#  IRS closing in on big winners in new gambling game Eagle Bucks!

The IRS is closing in on big winners of a new gambling game called Eagle Bucks! According to the IRS, players can win large sums of money by buying Eagle Bucks lottery tickets. Officials believe that many of the winners are not paying taxes on their winnings.

"This is a blatant attempt to avoid taxes," said an IRS spokesperson. "The people who are winning large sums of money should be paying their fair share to support our country."

Eagle Bucks is a new lottery game that is based on the popular Indian game of Paanch. Paanch is a game where players bet on how many eagles they can capture from a flock of crows. Eagle Bucks takes this concept one step further by allowing players to bet on how many eagle heads they can cut off from an image of an eagle.

"This game is becoming very popular because the potential payouts are so high," said one player. "I've already won several thousand dollars and I'm not even close to being done yet."

Players can buy tickets for Eagle Bucks at state-run lotteries or online from authorized ticket sellers. The odds of winning vary depending on the amount that has been wagered but typically range from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000.

Players must be at least 18 years old to play Eagle Bucks.

#  How Much Can You Win Gambling Before You Have To Pay Taxes?

The amount of money you can win gambling before you have to pay taxes depends on a variety of factors, including your income level and the type of gambling you are doing. Generally, however, the first $5,000 you win gambling is not taxable.

This exemption applies to all types of gambling income, including wins from casino games, lotteries, and horse racing. If you exceed the $5,000 limit, any additional gambling income is taxable. For example, if you win $7,000 in a casino in a single night, the first $5,000 is tax-free but the remaining $2,000 would be subject to income tax.

However, if you are considered a professional gambler and your gambling activities are considered a business rather than a hobby, all of your gambling income is taxable. This includes any net winnings as well as expenses related to your gambling activities.

There are also some other special rules that may apply when it comes to gambling taxes. For example, if you owe back taxes or child support payments, those amounts may be deducted from your gambling winnings. And if you receive unemployment benefits or welfare payments, those funds may be used to offset any gambling income you earn.

In general, though, the first $5,000 of your gambling winnings is not subject to taxation. So if you're looking for a little extra spending money and don't mind taking a chance on Lady Luck, go ahead and gamble – but remember to keep track of your wins and losses so you know exactly how much money you can keep tax-free!
