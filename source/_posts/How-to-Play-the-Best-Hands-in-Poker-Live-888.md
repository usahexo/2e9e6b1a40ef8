#  5 Hands to Play Every Time You Sit Down at a Poker Table

Poker is a game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skills levels. Whether you’re just starting out, or have been playing for years, there are certain hands that you should always play.

Let’s take a look at five of the most common hands in poker, and how to play them correctly.

#1 – The AA Hand

When you’re dealt the AA hand, you should almost always raise pre-flop. With such a strong hand, you want to put as much money in the pot as possible, in order to force your opponents to fold.

If someone does decide to call your bet, then it’s likely that they have a very good hand as well. In this case, you should start thinking about how best to engineer a winning situation.

#2 – The KK Hand

The KK hand is another strong hand that you should always play aggressively. Raise pre-flop, and if someone does decide to call your bet, go all-in if the pot is big enough. This will force your opponents to make a difficult decision – do they fold their good hand, or do they risk everything on a coin flip?

#3 – The QQ Hand

With the QQ hand, you should again be aggressive pre-flop. If someone does call your bet, then it’s likely that they have a strong hand too, so be prepared to showdown your cards and see who wins.

#4 – The JJ Hand

The JJ hand is another strong hand that you should play aggressively pre-flop. However, if someone does call your bet and it ends up going to a Showdown, then you may want to consider folding if there are any better hands out there. Remember – you don’t want to risk losing all of your chips on one hand!


















#  Winning Poker Tips - Playing the Right Hands

Poker is a game of skill and luck. The more you play, the better you get at reading your opponents, making the right decisions, and playing the right hands.

But even if you're a beginner, there are some basic tips that will help you play better poker and increase your chances of winning.

Here are the most important things to remember:

1. Play the hands that have the best chance of winning.

Don't be tempted to play a hand just because it's strong - sometimes it's better to fold rather than risk losing money. In general, you should only play hands that have at least a 66% chance of winning.

2. Know your odds.

To work out whether a hand has a good chance of winning, you need to know what the odds are. There are plenty of online calculators that will do this for you, or you can use one of the many poker books or websites that offer this information for free.

3. Be aware of your opponent's tendencies.

If you can read your opponents' betting patterns, you'll be able to make better decisions about which hands to play and when to fold. Watching how other players bet - and folding when they're likely to have a strong hand - is one of the keys to winning poker.

#  Poker Strategy: Playing the Top 5 Hands

In any given game of poker, the probability that you will be dealt a certain hand is fixed. But, the way you choose to play those hands can vary greatly, and can make all the difference in the outcome of the game. Here are five tips for playing your top five hands:

1. Straight Flush

When you are dealt a straight flush, it is always advisable to raise as much as possible. With such a strong hand, you want to force everyone else out of the game and win as much money as you can. Remember, there is a very good chance someone else will have a lesser hand, so don't be shy about putting your opponents all-in.

2. Four of a Kind

A four of a kind is a very powerful hand, and should be played aggressively in order to secure the most chips possible. Again, put your opponents all-in if they haven't folded by now. The only time you might want to play conservatively with this hand is if there is another player who also has a four of a kind; in that case, it might be best to just split the pot evenly.

3. Full House

A full house can be a tricky hand to play, but if played correctly it can lead to some big wins. If there are other players still in the game with fuller houses than yours, it might be wise to fold and wait for a better opportunity. However, if your full house is significantly better than anyone else's hand, go ahead and raise! This will force them to either fold or risk losing even more money.

4. Flush

If you are lucky enough to get dealt a flush, it's important not to overplay your hand. In general, it's best to just let other players do the betting for you until you can determine what sort of hand they are holding. If someone else bets big and it's clear they have something better than a flush, then fold and save your chips for later rounds.

5. Straight

A straight is another hand that should be played cautiously until you have determined what sort of hand your opponents hold. If someone bets aggressively early on and it's clear they have something better than a straight, then fold and wait for another opportunity; there's no need to risk losing all your chips unnecessarily. However, if you find yourself against weaker competition then feel free to raise as much as possible in order to take their money!
