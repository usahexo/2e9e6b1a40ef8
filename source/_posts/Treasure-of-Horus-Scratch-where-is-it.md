#  Treasure of Horus Scratch where is it?

Over the years, a number of people have speculated about where the treasure of Horus may be hidden. People have looked in caves, and tombs all over the world, but no one has found it yet. In this article, we will explore some of the possible locations of the treasure and discuss why it has yet to be found.

The first place that many people think of when they hear about the treasure of Horus is Egypt. After all, Horus was an Egyptian god, so it makes sense that his treasure would be in that area. However, there are several reasons why it is unlikely that the treasure is in Egypt. First of all, if it were in Egypt, it seems like someone would have found it by now. Secondly, most of the tombs and caves in Egypt have been explored and there is no evidence that the treasure is hiding there.

Another location that has been suggested as a possible hiding place for the treasure is Jerusalem. This makes sense because Horus was considered a god in both Egyptian and Hebrew cultures. However, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that the treasure is actually hidden in Jerusalem. Additionally, many people believe that Jerusalem has already been searched thoroughly and that there is no chance of finding the treasure there.

A third possible location for the treasure is Tibet. This suggestion comes from the fact that many ancient texts refer to an area known as Shambhala that is believed to be hidden in Tibet. Some people believe that this is where the treasure of Horus is located. However, there is no confirmed evidence to support this theory and most experts believe that Shambhala does not exist.

So if these are not likely locations for the treasure of Horus, where could it be? One possibility is that it is hidden on a secret island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. There are many islands in this area that have not been explored yet, so it could be hiding on one of them. Another possibility is that it is hidden in Antarctica. This location would make sense because it is far away from any other populated areas and it would be difficult to find without knowing exactly where to look.

There are many theories about where the treasure of Horus may be hidden, but no one has been able to find it yet. Perhaps one day someone will finally locate this elusive prize!

#  Treasure of Horus Scratch what do you win?

The Egyptian god Horus, represented as a falcon, is one of the most famous gods in ancient Egypt. Depicted as the god of kingship and Lower Egypt, he was often shown with his head crowned with a symbol known as the “uraeus”. Horus was believed to watch over the pharaoh and to help him in battle.

Horus was also associated with treasure, which made him a popular figure in stories and myths told by ancient Egyptians. One such story tells of how Horus acquired a fabulous treasure that he kept hidden away in a secret location.

According to the story, Horus had been given the treasure by his father, Osiris. Osiris had been killed by his brother Seth, but before he died he had entrusted Horus with the treasure. Seth had pursued Horus and tried to take the treasure from him, but Horus had been able to hide it away safely.

Years later, when Horus had become king of Egypt, he decided to reveal the location of the treasure to his people. He called together all of the wise men and scribes of Egypt and ordered them to write down the location of the treasure on a papyrus scroll.

The scroll was then hidden in a secret place, known only to Horus and his closest advisors. The location of the treasure was never revealed again, and it is said that it still remains hidden somewhere in Egypt today.
