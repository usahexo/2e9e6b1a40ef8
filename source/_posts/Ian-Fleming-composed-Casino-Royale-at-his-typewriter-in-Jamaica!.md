#  Ian Fleming composed Casino Royale at his typewriter in Jamaica!

When you think of the greatest ever spy novels, Ian Fleming’s Casino Royale is often cited as the first and best. What you may not know is that Fleming wrote the novel at his typewriter in Jamaica – where he had moved to escape the taxman.

Fleming had always been a keen amateur photographer, and he used his newly acquired interest in Caribbean wildlife to great effect in the novel. The villain of the story, Le Chiffre, is based on a real life French spymaster who Fleming had encountered during World War II.

Casino Royale was published on April 13th, 1953 and was an immediate success. It has since been adapted for stage, television and film multiple times, with Daniel Craig most recently taking on the role of James Bond in the 2006 movie adaptation.

#  Casino Royale – the book that was allegedly composed in 2 weeks!

Casino Royale is a novel, the first James Bond book, written by Ian Fleming. Published in 1953, it is the sixth James Bond book to be published and was not originally intended to be a Bond novel at all.

Fleming started writing the book on 16 January 1952 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica and finished it on 14 February 1952. As he later wrote: "I wrote Casino Royale in two weeks. I started it on January 16th and finished it on February 14th." 

The book was originally published in April 1953 by Jonathan Cape in the UK with a print run of 5,000 copies. It went out of print quickly and was later reprinted by Penguin Books in 1955. The story centres on the card game between Bond and Le Chiffre at Casino Royale.

Fleming wanted to give Bond a more human side and show that he could not just beat people up, so he gave him a love interest (Vera Mathis) and made him vulnerable. Fleming said that he based the character of Bond on several people he knew, but mostly upon himself, stating "when I was writing Casino Royale ... I wanted to create a world that was romantic, absurd and complicated." 

Since its release, Casino Royale has been adapted for stage, screen (twice), radio and video games.

#  Did Ian Fleming really compose Casino Royale in two weeks?

Casino Royale, Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, has been widely celebrated as a masterpiece of writing. Fleming's biographer, John Pearson, even claimed that the book was composed in just two weeks. But was Casino Royale really written that quickly?

There is evidence to suggest that Fleming actually took much longer to write the novel. For instance, an early draft of Casino Royale was apparently completed in April 1953 – more than nine months before the book was published. And in a letter to his friend Ivar Bryce, Fleming admitted that he was struggling to come up with new Bond stories: "I am rather worried because I have only six months worth of material left and I have not started on the next one."

It's possible that Pearson got his story wrong, or that Fleming changed his mind about how long it took him to write Casino Royale. Whatever the case may be, it's clear that this is one mystery that we may never solve.

#  Where was Ian Fleming when he composed Casino Royale?

The super spy, Ian Fleming wrote Casino Royale in 1952 while on holiday at his house, Goldeneye, in Jamaica. Fleming was a British journalist, best known for his James Bond series of spy novels. It is said that the house was given the name Goldeneye because of the color of Fleming's eyes.

Casino Royale tells the story of Bond's attempt to thwart a wealthy Russian criminal's plot to bankrupt the British economy by gambling in a high-stakes poker game. The book was originally intended to be a thriller-story anthology, but it soon developed into a novel. Fleming was forced to resort to novel writing due to his lack of experience as a screenwriter.

Fleming worked on the manuscript for six months and completed it in January 1952. The original title was "Longitude 78 West" and Casino Royale was published on April 13, 1953 by Jonathan Cape in the UK. The first edition had a print run of only 500 copies and was not a commercial success. However, today Casino Royale is considered one of Fleming's finest works and is often cited as the book that introduced 007 to the world.

#  How Ian Fleming composed Casino Royale

When Ian Fleming wrote Casino Royale, he had never written a novel before. He had, however, worked as a journalist and was familiar with the format. Fleming decided to write Casino Royale in the form of a travelogue, following Bond's journey to Madagascar and then on to Royale-les-Eaux.

Fleming began writing Casino Royale on 18 January 1952 and finished it on 28 March 1952. The first edition was published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 14 April 1953.

Fleming based the character of James Bond on several people he knew. One was Lieutenant Desmond Llewelyn, who Fleming had met during World War II. Fleming also based Bond's character on American playboy Hugh Hefner and British intelligence officer David Niven.

Casino Royale was an instant success and has been adapted for radio, television, stage and screen numerous times.
