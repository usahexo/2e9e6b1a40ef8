#  The Comanche who won big in the casino!

A Comanche Indian, who is also an enrolled member of the tribe, hit it big at a casino in Oklahoma. The man won nearly $1.8 million playing blackjack over a period of two days.

The unidentified gambler was playing at the Choctaw Nation Casino in Durant, OK., when he won the huge sum. He was playing with $500 chips and took home $1,785,000 after two days of betting.

Casino officials say the man has been a regular visitor to the casino but they are not releasing his name. It is not clear if he has any plans for his windfall but one would imagine he will be enjoying it for a while!

#  The Comanche who caused a bit of a scene at the casino!

A Comanche man who goes by the name of John, caused a bit of a scene at the casino last weekend. Apparently, John was playing blackjack and lost quite a bit of money. Feeling angry and frustrated, he started to yell and swear at the dealer and other players. Security were called and John was asked to leave.

This isn't the first time John has caused a scene at the casino. In fact, this is the third time in as many months that he's been asked to leave. His family and friends have warned him that his behaviour is affecting his reputation, but he doesn't seem to care. He's convinced that the casino is cheating him and he wants revenge.

John's behaviour is troubling, not just because it's disruptive, but also because it could lead to violence. It's only a matter of time before things escalate out of control and someone gets hurt. Maybe John needs some help dealing with his anger, or maybe he needs to find a new hobby altogether. Whatever the case may be, it's clear that he isn't doing himself or anyone else any favours by continuing down this path.

#  The Comanche who was banned from the casino!

There was a Comanche who was banned from the casino. He didn't understand why he was banned since he had never done anything wrong. One day, he decided to ask the security guard what had happened.

The security guard told him that he had been caught cheating. The Comanche couldn't believe it and asked to see the video footage. Sure enough, the security guard showed him the footage of him using a hidden camera to cheat at the slot machines.

The Comanche was heartbroken. He had never meant to cheat and was just trying to make some extra money. He apologized to the security guard and asked if there was any way he could be allowed back into the casino.

The security guard told him that there was no way he would be allowed back in, but he offered to help him find other ways to make money. The Comanche gratefully accepted his help and started working odd jobs around town.

He eventually saved up enough money to buy his own ranch and started raising horses. He was happy with his new life and was able to forget about what had happened at the casino.

#  The Comanche who cheated at the casino!

-Thirty years ago, a Comanche man rode into Vegas on his horse in an attempt to win big at the casino. 
-He was armed with nothing but raw talent and a few tricks up his sleeve- including the ability to cheat. 
-The man, who remains anonymous to this day, made a fortune at the blackjack tables by using sleight of hand to switch cards undetected. 
-What's even more impressive is that he did it all while wearing traditional Comanche dress. 
-His story is one of the most remarkable gambling tales of all time, and serves as a reminder that sometimes it's not just about the money- it's about using your wits and ingenuity to beat the system!

#  The Comanche who won over $100,000 at the casino!

Since the Comanche Nation is one of the federally recognized Native American tribes in the United States, they are allowed to operate casinos. And that's exactly what the Comanche have been doing for quite some time now, winning big at various establishments. In fact, one particular Comanche man has won over $100,000 at a casino!

It all started with a trip to WinStar World Casino and Resort in Oklahoma back in 2013. The Comanche man was enjoying some slots when he hit it big, walking away with a cool $100,062! As if that wasn't amazing enough, he would go on to win even more money at the casino – including another $8,000 prize just a few months later.

So how does a Comanche man manage to win so much money at the casino? Well, it likely has something to do with his tribe's long history of playing games of chance. The Comanche were known for their prowess as horse traders back in the day, and it seems that their luck has carried over into modern times.

In addition to hitting the jackpot at the casino, the Comanche man has also enjoyed some good luck when it comes to his personal life. For example, he was recently chosen to lead his tribe as its new chairman – making him one of the most influential members of his community.

Clearly, this Comanche man is having a great year! We can only hope that he continues his lucky streak and wins even more money at the casino in the future.
