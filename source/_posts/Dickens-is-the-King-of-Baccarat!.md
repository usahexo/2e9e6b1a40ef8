#  Dickens is the King of Baccarat!

Charles Dickens, one of the most renowned English novelists of all time, was also a passionate baccarat player. He is said to have wagered as much as £5,000 (the equivalent of about £250,000 today) in a single night!

Dickens was introduced to the game in 1864 by his friend, Wilkie Collins. At the time, baccarat was very popular in high society circles, and the two men enjoyed playing it together. In fact, Collins was even responsible for introducing Dickens to his future wife Catherine Hogarth.

Baccarat is a simple card game that typically involves three hands: player, banker and tie (although variants with more or fewer hands are possible). The aim of the game is to beat the banker's hand by either getting closer to nine than the banker, or by achieving a higher score than the banker with two or three cards.

For Dickens, baccarat was not just a game – it was an obsession. He would spend hours studying the mechanics of the game and formulating complex betting strategies. He was known to be particularly fond of betting on ties (a bet that pays out at 8-1 odds), which can be a risky move but can also result in big payouts.

Dickens was apparently a very talented player and he often managed to walk away from the table with winnings. However, he also suffered occasional losses, which he would typically take in good humour. On one occasion, after losing £200 (the equivalent of about £10,000 today), he wrote to his friend Collins: "I have been at home all this morning groaning over my disasters at baccarat last night."

Despite his love for the game, Dickens eventually decided to give up baccarat after losing heavily on a few occasions. In a letter written in 1868, he lamented: "The devil has got hold of me... I have been gambling ruinously at Baccarat for some days."


Baccarat has been around for centuries and is thought to have originated in Italy. However, it didn't become popular in England until Charles Dickens started playing it in the 1860s. Dickens was so enamoured with baccarat that he devoted many hours to studying it and formulating complex betting strategies. He was known to be particularly fond of betting on ties (a bet that pays out at 8-1 odds), which can be a risky move but can also result in big payouts.
